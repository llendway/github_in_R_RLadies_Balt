# Using Git and Github in RStudio: A Hands-on Session

Resources for my demo on 2021/12/14 for RLadies Baltimore. A link to slides viewable online will be added later. 

Links to a similar demo from RLadies Tunis can be found [here](https://llendway.github.io/rladies_github_for_collab/#1). And another beginner resource I created can be found [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md).
